# Weather2Wed

A group project completed as part of my CodeClan Course. 
The brief was to create a single page full-stack vanilla JavaScript app that displays information in a fun and interesting way (in 5 days).
Weather2Wed allows users to search for a location and date for their wedding, then the user is shown what (typically) the weather
is like in that location on that date.
